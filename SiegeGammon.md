# SiegeGammon

### The Invasion Game

*Where Backgammon is about retreat and escape, SiegeGammon is about advance and occupation. Deploy your forces, storm across the board, and seize enemy territory.*

---

## 1. Overview

SiegeGammon is a two-player strategy game played on a standard Backgammon board. It inverts Backgammon's core objective: instead of bearing checkers off the board, players deploy checkers onto the board from reserve and race to lock them into the opponent's home territory. The game rewards aggression, territorial control, and calculated risk.

**Players:** 2
**Equipment:** Standard Backgammon set — board with 24 points, 15 checkers per player (two distinct colors), 2 standard dice, 1 doubling cube

---

## 2. The Board

The board is a standard Backgammon board: 24 narrow triangles called **points**, numbered 1 through 24, arranged in four **quadrants** of 6 points each. A raised ridge (the **bar**) divides the board into two halves.

Each player numbers the board from their own perspective. Your point 1 is your opponent's point 24, and vice versa — identical to Backgammon.

### Quadrants

| Quadrant | Points | Name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| I | 1 - 6 | **Garrison** | Your deployment zone — checkers enter the board here |
| II | 7 - 12 | **Outer Field** | Transit territory on your half |
| III | 13 - 18 | **Far Field** | Transit territory on the opponent's half |
| IV | 19 - 24 | **Siege Zone** | Your target — lock checkers here to score |

> **Key spatial relationship:** Your Garrison (points 1-6) is physically the same area as your opponent's Siege Zone (their points 19-24). When you deploy into your Garrison, you are placing checkers in the territory your opponent is trying to conquer — and vice versa.

---

## 3. Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Reserve** | Your supply of checkers not yet on the board. All 15 start here. |
| **Deploy** | Move a checker from reserve onto a point in your Garrison (points 1-6). |
| **Advance** | Move a deployed checker forward (toward higher-numbered points). |
| **Lock** | Move a checker into your Siege Zone (points 19-24). It is permanently scored. |
| **Blot** | A single checker alone on a point. Vulnerable to being hit. |
| **Fortification** | Two or more of your checkers on the same point. Blocks the opponent. |
| **Rampart** | A sequence of consecutive fortified points (up to 6). An impassable wall. |
| **Hit** | Land on an opponent's blot, sending it back to their reserve. |

---

## 4. Setup

The board starts **completely empty**. Each player places all 15 checkers in their reserve, off the board. The doubling cube is placed centered between the players, showing no value (representing a stake of 1).

There are no starting positions to memorize. Every game begins from zero.

---

## 5. Objective

**Be the first player to lock all 15 checkers into your Siege Zone (points 19-24).**

A checker is locked the moment it enters any point in your Siege Zone. Locked checkers are permanently safe and cannot be moved or hit. The game ends instantly when a player locks their 15th checker.

---

## 6. Starting the Game

Each player rolls one die. The player who rolls higher goes first, using **both dice** (their roll and their opponent's roll) for the opening turn. If both players roll the same number, re-roll until they differ.

After the opening turn, players alternate turns.

---

## 7. Turn Structure

On each turn, a player performs the following steps in order:

1. **Offer a double** *(optional)* — Before rolling, you may propose to double the stakes (see Section 14: The Doubling Cube).
2. **Roll both dice.**
3. **Execute moves** — Deploy from reserve and/or advance checkers already on the board using the dice values rolled.

---

## 8. Movement Rules

### 8.1 Direction

All movement is **forward** — from low-numbered points to high-numbered points (from your perspective). A checker on point 5 moving with a die value of 3 lands on point 8. Checkers never move backward.

### 8.2 Using the Dice

Each die represents one separate move. The two dice may be applied to the **same checker** or to **two different checkers**.

- A single checker using both dice must be able to legally land on the **intermediate point**. For example, if you roll 3-5 and move one checker, it must be able to legally land on the point 3 ahead *or* 5 ahead before continuing. You may choose which die to apply first.
- You may freely mix **deployment** (from reserve) and **advancement** (of deployed checkers) in a single turn.

### 8.3 Doubles

When you roll doubles (e.g., 4-4), you receive **four moves** of that value instead of two. These four moves may be distributed among any combination of checkers.

### 8.4 Obligation to Move

- You **must use both dice** if it is legally possible to do so.
- If only one die can be legally used, you **must use the larger value**.
- If neither die can be used, your entire turn is forfeited.
- On doubles, you must play as many of the four moves as legally possible.
- You must choose the sequence of moves that **maximizes the total number of dice used**. If applying the smaller die first allows both dice to be used, but applying the larger die first only allows one, you must apply the smaller die first.

### 8.5 Legal Landing Points

A checker (whether deploying or advancing) may land on a point that is:

- **Empty** (no checkers on it), or
- **Friendly** (occupied by one or more of your own checkers), or
- **A blot** (occupied by exactly one opponent checker — this triggers a hit; see Section 10)

A point occupied by **two or more opponent checkers** (a fortification) is **blocked**. You may not land on it. You may not use it as an intermediate landing point for a combined move.

---

## 9. Deployment

Deploying is the act of moving a checker from your **reserve** onto a point in your **Garrison** (points 1-6).

### 9.1 How to Deploy

Use a die value to place a checker from reserve onto the corresponding point:

| Die Value | Deploys To |
|---|---|
| 1 | Your 1-point |
| 2 | Your 2-point |
| 3 | Your 3-point |
| 4 | Your 4-point |
| 5 | Your 5-point |
| 6 | Your 6-point |

The target point must be a legal landing point (empty, friendly, or an opponent's blot).

### 9.2 Deployment Is Voluntary

Unlike Backgammon's bar re-entry (which forces you to re-enter before making any other move), **deployment in SiegeGammon is never forced**. You may choose to advance existing checkers instead of deploying new ones, even if you have checkers remaining in reserve. Deployment is a strategic choice, not an obligation.

### 9.3 Multiple Deployments Per Turn

You may deploy more than one checker in a turn, using separate dice values. On doubles, you could deploy up to four checkers in a single turn.

### 9.4 Deployment and the Opponent's Siege Zone

Because your Garrison (points 1-6) is physically the same space as your opponent's Siege Zone (their points 19-24), deploying checkers into your Garrison places them in territory your opponent wants to conquer. This creates a natural defensive mechanism:

- **Fortifying your Garrison** (building 2+ checkers on points 1-6) blocks the opponent from locking checkers on the corresponding points in their Siege Zone.
- **Deploying onto an opponent's blot** in your Garrison hits it back to their reserve, potentially undoing significant progress.

This spatial overlap is a central strategic tension in SiegeGammon.

---

## 10. Hitting

When your checker lands (by exact die count) on a point occupied by a **single opponent checker** (a blot), that checker is **hit**.

### 10.1 Effect of a Hit

The hit checker is removed from the board and returned to the opponent's **reserve**. All of its forward progress is erased. The opponent must redeploy it from reserve on a future turn.

### 10.2 What Cannot Be Hit

- **Fortified checkers** — A point with 2 or more opponent checkers cannot be landed on at all.
- **Locked checkers** — Checkers that have reached their Siege Zone are permanently safe (see Section 11).

### 10.3 Hitting During Deployment

If you deploy a checker (from reserve onto your Garrison) and the target point contains a single opponent checker, that opponent checker is hit and returned to their reserve. This frequently occurs because your Garrison overlaps with their Siege Zone.

---

## 11. Locking (Scoring Checkers)

Locking is the core scoring mechanism. When a checker enters your **Siege Zone** (points 19-24 from your perspective), it becomes **locked** — permanently scored, immovable, and unhittable.

### 11.1 How Locking Works

A checker locks by advancing into any point numbered 19 through 24 (from your perspective). The die value used must move the checker to a point that is a **legal landing point** within or beyond the Siege Zone.

**Examples:**

- A checker on point 16 with a die roll of 3 advances to point 19. It is now locked.
- A checker on point 17 with a die roll of 6 would move to point 23. It is now locked.
- A checker on point 20 with a die roll of 5 would move to point 25 — beyond the board. See Section 11.3 for excess rolls.

### 11.2 No Gathering Requirement

Unlike Backgammon (where all 15 checkers must be in the home board before bearing off can begin), **SiegeGammon has no such prerequisite**. Any checker that reaches the Siege Zone at any time is immediately locked, regardless of where the other 14 checkers are. This is a fundamental difference from Backgammon and keeps the game aggressive.

### 11.3 Excess Rolls and Locking

When a checker is close to or inside the Siege Zone, excess roll values are handled as follows:

**Checker is approaching the Siege Zone (points 13-18):**
- A die value that moves the checker to any point 19-24 locks it on that exact point. There is no choice — the checker lands where the die puts it.
- A die value that would move the checker beyond point 24 is **legal only if the landing point within the Siege Zone (point 19-24) is a valid intermediate or final position**. If a checker on point 20 rolls a 6, it cannot land on point 26 — see below.

**Checker is already in the Siege Zone (points 19-24):**
- A locked checker **cannot be moved**. It is permanently fixed.
- Therefore, dice values cannot be applied to locked checkers. You must use your dice on other checkers.

**Overshoot rule:**
- A checker may **only** advance to points that exist on the board (points 1-24).
- If a die value would move a checker beyond point 24, that move is **illegal** unless there is no checker on any point higher than the checker's current position within the Siege Zone.
- This mirrors Backgammon's bearing-off logic: if a checker is on point 22 and you roll a 5 (which would go to point 27), you may lock it off the board **only if no friendly checker exists on points 23 or 24**. If a friendly checker does exist on a higher-numbered point, you must move that higher checker instead or use the die value on a different checker entirely.

> **Simplified:** Overshooting beyond point 24 follows the same rules as bearing off in Backgammon — you can only overshoot from the highest occupied point when no higher checkers need moving first.

### 11.4 Locked Checker Placement

Locked checkers are placed aside off the board (or stacked visibly to track count). They no longer occupy any point. The physical points in the Siege Zone remain available for other checkers (both yours and your opponent's) to land on or pass through.

> **Important:** Locking removes the checker from the board. It does not create a permanent fortification on that point. Your opponent can still deploy onto or move through those points.

---

## 12. Blocking and Ramparts

### 12.1 Fortifications

A point occupied by **two or more of your checkers** is a **fortification**. The opponent cannot land on a fortified point — it is completely blocked. It also cannot be used as an intermediate landing point for a combined move.

### 12.2 Ramparts

A **rampart** is a consecutive sequence of fortified points. Since no single die can roll higher than 6, a rampart of **6 consecutive fortified points** is an absolute wall — no opposing checker can pass through it.

Ramparts of fewer than 6 points are still powerful but can be jumped with a high enough single die value.

### 12.3 Strategic Blocking Positions

- **Garrison fortifications** (your points 1-6) block the opponent from locking checkers in their Siege Zone. This is the primary defensive mechanism.
- **Outer Field ramparts** (points 7-12) trap opponent checkers that have deployed but not yet advanced far.
- **Far Field ramparts** (points 13-18) choke the opponent's most advanced checkers just short of their Siege Zone.
- **Siege Zone fortifications** — Since locked checkers are removed from the board, you cannot permanently block your Siege Zone. But you *can* temporarily park unlocked checkers on high-numbered points to block your opponent's approach to their Siege Zone (which is your Garrison).

## 13. Winning the Game

The game ends **immediately** when a player locks their 15th checker. That player wins.

### 13.1 Scoring

| Result | Condition | Score |
|---|---|---|
| **Standard Win** | Opponent has locked at least 1 checker | 1 x cube value |
| **Siege** *(double stakes)* | Opponent has locked **zero** checkers | 2 x cube value |
| **Total Siege** *(triple stakes)* | Opponent has locked **zero** checkers **and** still has at least one checker in reserve | 3 x cube value |

- A **Siege** (analogous to a gammon) means the opponent never established any foothold in your territory.
- A **Total Siege** (analogous to a backgammon) means the opponent couldn't even get all their forces onto the battlefield — a complete rout.

### 13.2 Final Score Calculation

**Final score = Result multiplier (1, 2, or 3) x Doubling cube value**

*Example: A Total Siege with the cube at 4 = 3 x 4 = 12 points.*

---

## 14. The Doubling Cube

The doubling cube works identically to Backgammon.

### 14.1 Initial State

The cube starts **centered** between the players at an implied value of 1. When centered, either player may offer the first double.

### 14.2 Offering a Double

**Before rolling the dice** on your turn, you may propose to double the stakes. The opponent has two choices:

- **Accept (take):** The game continues at the new doubled stake. The accepting player takes possession of the cube, meaning only they may offer the next double.
- **Decline (drop):** The game ends immediately. The declining player loses at the **current** stake (before the proposed double).

### 14.3 Redoubling

Once a player owns the cube, only they may propose the next double (a redouble). After a redouble is accepted, ownership passes to the accepting player. There is no limit to the number of redoubles.

### 14.4 Cube Values

The doubling cube shows: **2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64**.

---

## 15. Match Play Rules *(Optional)*

For tournament or series play:

### 15.1 Match Format

A match is played to a target number of points (e.g., first to 7). Players accumulate points across multiple games.

### 15.2 Crawford Rule

When a player is exactly **1 point away** from winning the match, the next game is the **Crawford game**. During the Crawford game, **neither player may use the doubling cube**. After the Crawford game, the cube is available again for all subsequent games.

### 15.3 Jacoby Rule *(Money Play Only)*

In casual money play: Sieges and Total Sieges only count as double/triple stakes if the **doubling cube has been turned at least once** during that game. If the cube was never used, all wins count as standard (1x). This encourages cube action.

## 17. Strategy Guide

### 17.1 Opening Principles

- **Deploy aggressively in the early game.** Checkers in reserve contribute nothing. Getting pieces on the board creates options and applies pressure.
- **Occupy key Garrison points.** Fortifying your 5-point and 4-point early mirrors Backgammon opening theory — these are the hardest points for your opponent to bypass.
- **Don't ignore defense.** Every checker you deploy in your Garrison is also a blocker for your opponent's Siege Zone. Balance offense and defense.

### 17.2 Mid-Game Tactics

- **Build ramparts in the Outer or Far Field.** A 4-5 point rampart across the center of the board can strangle the opponent's advance while your forces march forward.
- **Hit aggressively.** Sending a checker back to reserve erases all its progress — far more punishing than in Backgammon (where a hit checker at least re-enters in opponent territory). Every hit is devastating.
- **Advance in pairs.** Solo advanced checkers (blots) deep in enemy territory are easy targets. Move checkers forward together to maintain fortifications.

### 17.3 End-Game Considerations

- **Lock efficiently.** When you have many checkers approaching the Siege Zone, roll economy matters. Don't waste high die values on short advances when a lower value could lock a closer checker.
- **Garrison defense becomes critical.** As the game nears its end, both players are trying to lock their remaining checkers. Keeping fortifications in your Garrison denies the opponent easy locks.
- **Cube timing.** If you have a significant locking advantage (more checkers locked, strong position), offer the double. If your opponent's position is crumbling, they may drop rather than face a Siege.

### 17.4 Key Differences from Backgammon Strategy

- **No "race" phase.** Backgammon often simplifies to a pure race in the late game. SiegeGammon's spatial overlap (your Garrison = their Siege Zone) means contact persists until the very end.
- **Deployment timing is a weapon.** Holding checkers in reserve can be strategic — deploying late to hit blots in your Garrison (their Siege Zone) just as the opponent thinks they're about to lock.
- **Primes are more oppressive.** Since checkers can never move backward, a prime traps advancing checkers permanently until it breaks.
